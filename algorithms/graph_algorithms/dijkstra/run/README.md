# Dijkstra Test Suite

Test runners for all language implementations. All use identical test cases from `test_cases.json`.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Individual languages
python3 run.py
ruby run.rb
node run.js

# Full benchmark with timing
./benchmark.sh
```

## Test Cases

Weighted graph with costs. Tests validate both heap-based and array-based implementations.
