Prompt used to generate this tasks.md:

Read this @README.md  file in details for an open-source project comparing various programming languages. Then, write a tasks.md file, which will be a plan of implementation for the project, step by step. Don't refrain adding some more steps or creative things that doesn't exist in README yet.
```
<think>
Let me create a tasks.md file for this language comparison project based on the README.md that was provided. I'll organize this as a comprehensive implementation plan with concrete steps, milestones, and additional ideas that could enhance the project beyond what's already mentioned in the README.

The tasks should cover:
1. Project setup
2. Implementation of algorithms in different languages
3. Implementation of design patterns in different languages
4. Benchmarking setup
5. Reporting system
6. Project expansion steps
7. Community building aspects

I'll also add some creative extensions that aren't explicitly mentioned in the README but would enhance the value of the project.
