#### 1. Create README.md
This is a project for comparing programming languages in terms of speed on various algorithms, and also comparing them on their expressivity and maintainabilty on complex software projects.

in this repo, create bunch of folders with algorithm names, for example finbonacci, mandelbrot, merge sort, cryptography, and many others. For each folder, write the same algorithm in python, javascript, c, c++, rust, and scheme. Then, run a bash script that runs all of them and record how much time they take, and prepare a .md report on the folder itself based on their speed, line of codes for each and vice versa.

Then, for some repos, implement various software design patterns in each language, and with a bash report report how long they take. Use @https://github.com/cgag/loc project to count line of codes.

Before creating repos, and other things, populate the README.md file with how you will structure and organize this creative project. 

On top of that, think about next steps and what else can be done, and also note them down in README.md


#### 2. Plan
Read this @README.md  file in details for an open-source project comparing various programming languages. Then, write a tasks.md file, which will be a plan of implementation for the project, step by step. Don't refrain adding some more steps or creative things that doesn't exist in README yet.

[I put the result in tasks.md file, and made some minor changes on it]


#### 3. Phase 1: project setup
Do the Phase 1 of @tasks.md after reading @README.md  

#### 4. Phase 1 (continued)
For all the files in @environment_setup directory , populate them accordingly based on how to setup the environment. For context, check first @README.md and @tasks.md . This can be thought as the part of Phase 1 of @tasks.md 

#### 5. Phase 2: Implementing some algorithms
Do the Phase 2 of @tasks.md after reading @README.md  

note: this prompt haven't been completed, could only implemented the fibonacci algorithm, probably its context wasn't enough for all algorithms together.
